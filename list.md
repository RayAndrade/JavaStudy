### **Creational Patterns in Java**  
Creational patterns in Java focus on simplifying and standardizing object creation while ensuring flexibility and minimizing dependencies.

1. **Singleton**  
Ensures a class has only one instance, implemented using private constructors and synchronized methods for thread safety.

2. **Factory Method**  
Defines a method for object creation, allowing subclasses to decide which class to instantiate dynamically.

3. **Abstract Factory**  
Provides an interface for creating families of related objects without specifying their concrete implementations.

4. **Builder**  
Separates the construction of complex objects from their representation, using fluent methods for flexibility and clarity.

5. **Prototype**  
Creates new objects by cloning existing ones, leveraging `Cloneable` and overriding the `clone()` method for efficient duplication.

### **Structural Patterns in Java**  
Structural patterns emphasize organizing classes and objects for better composition, maintainability, and scalability in Java.

6. **Adapter**  
Converts one interface into another expected by clients, using inheritance or delegation to bridge incompatibility.

7. **Bridge**  
Decouples abstraction from implementation by combining interfaces and concrete implementations, enabling independent extension.

8. **Composite**  
Groups objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies, leveraging recursion and polymorphism in Java.

9. **Decorator**  
Dynamically adds behavior to objects without modifying their code, often using wrapping and interfaces.

10. **Facade**  
Provides a unified interface to a complex subsystem, simplifying interaction by encapsulating multiple components into one.

11. **Flyweight**  
Shares common state among multiple objects to reduce memory usage, using object pooling or caching mechanisms.

12. **Proxy**  
Acts as a surrogate to control access to another object, often used for lazy initialization or access control.

### **Behavioral Patterns in Java**  
Behavioral patterns in Java manage communication and workflows between objects, enhancing flexibility and dynamic interactions.

13. **Chain of Responsibility**  
Passes a request through a chain of handlers, each deciding whether to handle or forward it.

14. **Command**  
Encapsulates requests as objects, allowing parameterization, queuing, and undo/redo functionality in Java applications.

15. **Interpreter**  
Defines a grammar and interprets expressions, suitable for scripting engines, configuration parsers, or DSLs.

16. **Iterator**  
Provides a standard way to traverse collections using Java’s `Iterator` or enhanced for-loops.

17. **Mediator**  
Centralizes communication between objects, reducing dependencies with event-based systems or a mediator class.

18. **Memento**  
Captures and restores an object’s state without exposing its details, commonly used for undo operations.

19. **Observer**  
Implements a one-to-many relationship where dependents are notified of changes, often using Java’s `Observer` and `Observable`.

20. **State**  
Allows an object to change its behavior dynamically based on its internal state, modeled using state classes.

21. **Strategy**  
Encapsulates interchangeable algorithms into separate classes, promoting flexibility and reuse for tasks like sorting or validation.

22. **Template Method**  
Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class, deferring specific steps to subclasses.

23. **Visitor**  
Encapsulates operations performed on elements of an object structure, enabling new functionality without modifying them.
