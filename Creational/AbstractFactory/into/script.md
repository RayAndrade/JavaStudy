**Abstract Factory Design Pattern for Java Developers**

**Definition**  
The **Abstract Factory** pattern provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

### 🔍 **5 Reasons to Study the Abstract Factory Pattern (for Java Developers)**

1. **Modularity**  
Encourages code that’s easier to maintain by abstracting object creation for UI themes or database drivers.

2. **Scalability**  
Enables building complex systems—like GUI frameworks—where object families must evolve without breaking code.

3. **Flexibility**  
Supports switching between different product variants (e.g., different OS widgets) with minimal code changes.

4. **Consistency**  
Helps ensure that Java components from the same family are used together, avoiding incompatibility bugs.

5. **Testability**  
Facilitates mocking dependencies in unit tests by abstracting object creation behind factory interfaces.
